# IBM Data Science Capstone Project 
## SpaceX Launch Analysis

## Overview
A comprehensive analysis project within the IBM Data Science Certificate program, focusing on commercial space flight optimization.

## Project Context
SpaceX has revolutionized commercial spaceflight through cost reduction, offering Falcon 9 launches at $62M compared to competitors' $165M+. Their cost advantage stems from first-stage rocket reusability. This project uses public data and machine learning to predict first-stage recovery success.

## Research Objectives
1. Analyze impact of key variables (payload, launch site, flight count, orbital parameters) on booster recovery
2. Track landing success rate progression
3. Identify optimal binary classification algorithm

## Project Phases

### 1. Data Collection
- REST API integration with SpaceX
- Wikipedia data extraction via web scraping

### 2. Data Processing
- Dataset refinement
- Null value handling
- Binary classification preparation through One Hot Encoding

### 3. Data Analysis
- Launch site performance evaluation
- SQL-based data mining and aggregation
- Statistical pattern identification

### 4. Interactive Visualization
- Geographic mapping of launch/landing sites using Folium
- Dynamic analytics dashboard via Plotly Dash
- Performance metric visualization

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Classification model development
- Parameter optimization
- Performance evaluation

This project synthesizes data science techniques to optimize space launch operations through predictive analytics.
